**Information Security Student** | **Frontend Developer** | **Application Security Advocate**

## 🛡️ Security-First Development

I build scalable web applications with security embedded at every layer—from secure authentication flows and role-based access control to input validation and threat mitigation. My approach combines hands-on full-stack development with a security engineering mindset, informed by my formal education in Information Security and practical implementation of defense-in-depth principles.

**Current Focus:** Transitioning from secure full-stack development into Application Security Engineering and Penetration Testing, with active research in OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, secure architecture patterns, and threat modeling frameworks.
